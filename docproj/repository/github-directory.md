# The `./github/` folder

The `.github/` folder is a place to store repository- or account-level GitHub configuration and community health files (like CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, issue and PR templates in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/, FUNDING.yml, etc.).

If you create a public repository named .github in an account, GitHub will use files from that repository as defaults for any repositories owned by the account that don’t have their own copy — following the precedence: the repository’s .github folder → the repo root → the docs folder.

Default files in a .github repository:

* are used when no per-repository file exists,
* won’t appear in the file browser or Git history of individual repositories,
* aren’t included in clones, packages, or downloads,
* require the .github repository to be public to apply organization-wide.

How to create defaults:

1. Create a new repository named .github under the desired owner and make it public.
2. Add supported files (e.g., CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*, SECURITY.md, FUNDING.yml) in the root, .github/ folder, or docs/ folder of that repo.
