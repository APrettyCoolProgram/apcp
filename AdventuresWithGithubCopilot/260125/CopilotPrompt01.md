# Copilot prompt 01

This prompt was used for:

- DungineStudio

```text
I've started to write a game engine called "Dungine" that will play various types of games. Currently the only type of game is text-based adventure games.

I would like the DungineStudio project to be an application where I can design/develop games that can be played in the Dungine game engine.

All of the data/resources for each game is contained in a "cartridge" folder. I've provided an example of a text based game named "HauntedMansion" in the root of this project. 

Please use that as an example, and create a modern user interface that will allow a user to:

- Create text-based games
- Load an existing "cartridge" by choosing a "cartridge folder" that contains game data
- Detailed controls allowing the creation of locations, items, descriptions, and anything else needed for the game
