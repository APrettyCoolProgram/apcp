Adventures:

- [DungineStudio]()

## DungeonStudio

- AI model: Claude Sonnet 4.5
- [Initial prompt](CopilotPrompt01.md)
- [Copilot documentation](./DungineStudio/DungineStudio-Copilot-Documentation.md)
- [Project files](./DungeonStudio/)

Initial prompt worked as expected.

Additional prompts were used to clean things up.

As of v0.0.0.2, this has been moved to [here](https://github.com/CalistadalaneGames/DungineStudio/tree/main) for further development.
