# Copilot prompt 02

This prompt was used for:

- Dungine

```text
I would like to create a game engine called "Dungine" that eventually can be used to develop and play a variety of game types, in both 2D and 3D.

While it should be designed with extensiblity in mind, to start with, I would like the engine to play text-based adventure games like Zork.

I would like to use Godot 4.5.1, and play the game on Windows, MacOS, and the web

When generating code, I would prefer .NET 10 C# over GDScript, when possible.
