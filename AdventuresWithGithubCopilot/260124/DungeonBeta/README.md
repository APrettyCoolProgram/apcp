# Dungeon: Beta

Minimal single-player card game prototype for Godot 4.5.1 using C# (.NET 10).

Goals:

- 10-level dungeon progression
- Decks of 40 cards
- 3 slots per player; slot combat resolves when turns end

Quick start (Windows / macOS):

1. Install Godot 4.5.1 with .NET support (Mono/.NET 10).
2. Open this project folder in Godot.
3. Ensure your dotnet SDK is available to Godot (see Godot docs).
4. Open `Scenes/Main.tscn` and press Play.

Files added:

- `Scripts/*` — core C# game logic
- `Scenes/Main.tscn` — scene with `GameManager`
- `Scenes/Card.tscn` — placeholder UI card
- `Dungeon-Beta-Copilot-Documentation.md` — documentation of this session
