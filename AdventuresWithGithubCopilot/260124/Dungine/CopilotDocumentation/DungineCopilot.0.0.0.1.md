# DungineCopilot Transcript

This document contains the prompts you (the user) gave and the assistant's responses and work performed while building the Dungine text-adventure engine in this workspace.

---

## User Prompts (verbatim)

1) Initial request (Jan 24, 2026):

"I would like to create a game engine called "Dungine" that eventually can be used to develop and play a variety of game types, in both 2D and 3D.

While it should be designed with extensiblity in mind, to start with, I would like the engine to play text-based adventure games like Zork.

I would like to use Godot 4.5.1, and play the game on Windows, MacOS, and the web

When generating code, I would prefer .NET 10 C# over GDScript, when possible."

2) User later asked to update to .NET 10 C#:

"Update the code to use .NET 10 C#"

3) User later asked to update the version:

"Update the the version of Dungine to 0.0.0.1"

4) Final request to create this document:

"Create a document named \"DungineCopilot.md\" that contains all of the prompts I have given you, and all of the responses/work you have done."

## Assistant Responses, Actions, and Work (chronological summary)

- Initial acknowledgement: "I'll help you create the Dungine game engine in Godot 4.5.1 with C# support for text-based adventure games. Let me start by examining your existing project setup and then create a comprehensive architecture." 

- Read `project.godot` and reported it was configured for C# with assembly name "Dungine".

- Created a TODO list for the work and progressed through tasks.

- Created project files and code (all C#):
  - `Dungine.csproj` (project file) — configured for Godot.NET.Sdk/4.5.1 and initially `net8.0`, later updated to `net10.0`.
  - `.gitignore`

- Created core engine source files under `Core/`:
  - `Core/GameObject.cs` — `IGameObject` and `GameObject` base class
  - `Core/Location.cs` — `Location` with exits and item management
  - `Core/Item.cs` — `Item` with container support and aliases
  - `Core/Inventory.cs` — `Inventory` to manage player's items
  - `Core/World.cs` — `World` and `WorldData`/`LocationData`/`ItemData` for loading worlds
  - `Core/GameState.cs` — `GameState` node tracking world, inventory, running state

- Created parser and command system:
  - `Parser/TextParser.cs` — `TextParser` and `ParsedCommand`
  - `Commands/CommandProcessor.cs` — processor registering commands and dispatching
  - `Commands/DefaultCommands.cs` — built-in commands (`look`, `go`, `take`, `drop`, `inventory`, `examine`, `help`, `quit`)

- Created UI controller and scene:
  - `UI/GameController.cs` — Control node that builds a simple text UI, loads a demo world, and hooks input to commands
  - `Scenes/Main.tscn` — Scene referencing `UI/GameController.cs` and a background `ColorRect`

- Wrote `README.md` describing the engine, architecture, and usage instructions.

- After user request to use .NET 10, updated `Dungine.csproj` to target `net10.0` and updated `README.md` prerequisites to reference `.NET 10.0 SDK`.

- After user request to bump version to `0.0.0.1`, made these updates:
  - Added `<Version>0.0.0.1</Version>` to `Dungine.csproj`.
  - Added `public const string EngineVersion = "0.0.0.1";` to `UI/GameController.cs` and updated startup output to display the version in the title line.
  - Updated `README.md` section "Current Implementation" to show version `v0.0.0.1`.

- Final assistant summary message listing created files and features.

## Notes About the Work

- All code was implemented in C# for Godot 4.5.1 and updated to target .NET 10.0 as requested.
- The engine's initial focus is text-adventure support; the architecture is modular to allow future 2D/3D expansion.
- The demo world included in `UI/GameController.cs` is a small Zork-like world with multiple interconnected locations and example items.

## If you want more

- I can append full file contents or diffs for any of the created files into this document if you want an exact copy here.
- I can commit these changes to git, run a build, or attempt to run the project in Godot and report any runtime build issues.
